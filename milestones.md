# Milestones

## Milestone 1

### Maxim
What you did: Created the slides for the Milestone 1 video and helped determine what type of work needs to be done going forward.\
What you plan to do: I plan to work with Ben to better understand the ML side of the project and begin training models.\
What are you stuck on: The ML/math of Carlini’s paper\

### Ben
What you did: Put together design doc, organized agenda for our meeting, made video presentation\
What you plan to do: Work on creating a captcha image subset and collaborate with Maxim on the ML side\
What are you stuck on: Understanding the substance of Carlinis methods as well as how to go about creating the images we'll be using\

### James
What you did: Created sketch of website. Worked on milestones.md\
What you plan to do: Work on the UI of project and Captcha generation\
What are you stuck on: N/A\

### Tammer
What you did: Researched how the user(or bot) input is matched to the correct input and the overall matching algorithm and added a hard-coded matching algorithm to the program.\
What you plan to do: I plan on working on a flexible matching algorithm or find outside code that I can adapt to work with our specific project to make the matching dynamic.\
What are you stuck on: Actual implementation as it will require a stronger foundation for our project to be applied.\

### Maxim
What you did:Implemented FGSM and MI-FGSM attacks and tested them on MNIST and Chars74K datasets.\
What you plan to do: Experimentation with attack parameters and assessing attack success rate and making notebooks into proper Python scripts\
What are you stuck on: Figuring out what is the best way to test for the best parameters.\

### Ben
What you did: Explored adversarial examples with Maxim, began refactoring model training/attack methods from Carlini.\
What you plan to do: Reimplement Carlini's minimal attack within the confines of our basic model. If this becomes unfeasible I plan to assist Maxim. \
What are you stuck on: Refactoring Carlini’s minimal attack code to work with Tensorflow 2.0.\

### James
What you did: Researched methods on how to match characters entered in a textbox to the captcha displayed to the user.\
What you plan to do: Implement the captcha detection algorithm within the website\
What are you stuck on: Figuring out what the most optimal algorithm to use is.\
Links to commits:

### Tammer
What you did: Planning for how the website will be able to lay out the individual captcha images and how to store individual images within a database for matching to the actual letter.\
What you plan to do: Collaborate with James on our end of the project.\
What are you stuck on: Our database and matching input with image and overall website layout to insert the images.\
