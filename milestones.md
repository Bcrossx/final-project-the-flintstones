## Milestone 1

### Maxim
What you did: Created the slides for the Milestone 1 video and helped determine what type of work needs to be done going forward.\
What you plan to do: I plan to work with Ben to better understand the ML side of the project and begin training models.\
What are you stuck on: The ML/math of Carlini’s paper\

### Ben
What you did: Put together design doc, organized agenda for our meeting, made video presentation\
What you plan to do: Work on creating a captcha image subset and collaborate with Maxim on the ML side\
What are you stuck on: Understanding the substance of Carlinis methods as well as how to go about creating the images we'll be using\

### Tammer
What you did: Researched how the user(or bot) input is matched to the correct input and the overall matching algorithm and added a hard-coded matching algorithm to the program.\
What you plan to do: I plan on working on a flexible matching algorithm or find outside code that I can adapt to work with our specific project to make the matching dynamic.\
What are you stuck on: Actual implementation as it will require a stronger foundation for our project to be applied.\
